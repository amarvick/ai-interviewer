What this should do:

1. submission schema is built via router
2. Do we want to make it so we check against edge cases here? I think that makes sense because the client should not
    have to worry about that nor should it be allowed to (strict backend check only)
3. We would need to query the problem to get the test cases, run against them and then check.
4. Reminds me - should we consider an object for test cases that are linked to a problem?
